      This repository consists of two independent data-driven projects, both showcasing analytical and visualization skills using real-world datasets and tools like Python, Pandas, TextBlob, and Matplotlib.
      Each project focuses on transforming raw data into clear insights — one in the entertainment domain and the other in environmental policy.


    Project 1: IMDb Movie Sentiment Analysis
    
This project analyzes audience opinions from IMDb reviews and aggregates sentiment at the movie level using NLP tools like TextBlob.
Each review is scored for sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative), then averaged by movie title to identify which films are most loved or criticized.

Steps:

Preprocessed text data (removed HTML, punctuation, lowercase).
Computed sentiment polarity using TextBlob and lexicon fallback.
Assigned 15 well-known movies (e.g., Inception, Joker, Titanic).
Aggregated reviews to calculate average sentiment and review count.
Visualized results with bar and pie charts.

Outputs:

Top 10 Positive & Negative Movies (Bar Charts)
Sentiment Distribution (Pie Chart)
Movie_Sentiment_Detailed_Report_With_Charts.docx

Insights:

Positive language like amazing or masterpiece increases sentiment.
Higher review counts yield more balanced sentiment averages.

Conclusion:

Demonstrates how text-based audience feedback can be transformed into actionable insights using basic NLP. Future improvements can include BERT for better contextual understanding.



    Project 2: Global CO₂ Accountability – A Policy Brief
    
This policy brief analyzes global carbon emissions data (2023) to identify top emitters and recommend targeted decarbonization strategies.
The analysis focuses on absolute emissions, per capita emissions, and per GDP emissions to compare responsibility among major global economies.

Key Findings:

Top Emitters: China (4,612 MtCO₂), USA (1,992 MtCO₂), EU27 & UK (1,361 MtCO₂).
Top Sectors: power (39.7%), Industry (27.7%), Ground Transport (17.5%).
Per Capita: USA leads at 5.8 tCO₂/person.
Per GDP: China is highest at 0.26 tCO₂/thousand USD.

Policy Recommendations:

Accelerate Power Sector Decarbonization – Shift rapidly to renewable energy.
Mandate Industrial Efficiency – Enforce low-carbon technologies in high-intensity sectors.
Reduce Transport Emissions in High Per Capita Regions – Promote EVs and public transport.

Conclusion:

Achieving global climate goals requires focused efforts on major emitters and high-intensity sectors.
Tailored strategies — lifestyle change in high per capita regions and industrial reform in high per GDP regions — are critical for a sustainable, low-carbon future.
